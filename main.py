# # Task 1: Happy Numbers
# # A happy number is a number defined by the following process: starting with any 
# # positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and 
# # repeat the process until the number equals 1. An example of a happy number is 19
# # (For more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number)
# # Write a method that determines if a number is happy or sad
